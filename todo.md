## to-do list

* make the UI simpler
* adapter / adaptor
* get rid of rare words; filter / rank by rarity
** get rid of most names (people names and place names)
* pot / spot
* dynamically blacklist words from datamuse
** set_related friendship
* what happens if we turn all 0's into schwas?
* figure out the best $datamuse_max
* imperfect rhymes
** snapshot -> trap's wrought (if that were an actual phrase)
** sitter / admit her
* filter out words containing numbers
* combine plurals using (s) - optional in text mode, auto in CGI mode. maybe possessives too?
* test phrases

## could-do list

* use wiktionary instead of cmudict
* make words links
* add a clickable "x" for "this is a dumb word that should be stricken from the list forever"
* guess at pronunciations of unknown words
* don't use json for the internal dictionaries - it would be nice to be able to grep them
