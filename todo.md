## to-do list

* this is just a spurious to-do item to make sure git is working
* test phrases
* eliminate_stupid_rhymes
* factor out display from logic
* imperfect rhymes
** snapshot -> trap's wrought (if that were an actual phrase)
* is_stupid_rhyme gets rid of e.g. pot / spot, which is a perfectly good rhyme.

## could-do list

* filter / rank by rarity
* guess at pronunciations of unknown words
