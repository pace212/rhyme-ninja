## to-do list

* is_stupid_rhyme gets rid of e.g. pot / spot, which is a perfectly good rhyme.
* tests
* imperfect rhymes
** snapshot -> trap's wrought (if that were an actual phrase)
** sitter / admit her
* filter / rank by rarity
* filter out slurs
* filter out words containing numbers
* combine plurals using (s) - optional in text mode, auto in CGI mode
* test phrases

## could-do list

* guess at pronunciations of unknown words
* don't use json for the internal dictionaries - it would be nice to be able to grep them
